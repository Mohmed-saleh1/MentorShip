# Statically typed language 
 
* In a statically typed language (e.g.,Rust,C,C++,TypeScript), variable types are declared and checked at compile-time. This catches type-related errors early in the development process, making the code more robust and easier to maintain.

# Dinamically typed language 
- In a dynamically typed language (e.g., JavaScript, Python), variable types are determined at runtime. There's no need to explicitly declare types, offering flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors if types are mismatched.
