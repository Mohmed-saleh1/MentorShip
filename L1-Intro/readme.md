# What is TypeScript 

* TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. 
* It helps catch errors early and enhances code quality by allowing developers to specify variable types.
* The TypeScript code is eventually compiled into JavaScript for execution.

# Why we need TypeScript
* Static Typing: Catches errors early by specifying variable types.
* JavaScript Compatibility: Can be used with existing JavaScript code.
* Code Maintainability: Improves code readability and collaboration.

# How TypeScript works 

* TypeScript is a programming language that extends JavaScript by adding static types. It helps catch errors early in the development process, enhances code quality, and provides additional features, making it easier to maintain and scale JavaScript projects.
